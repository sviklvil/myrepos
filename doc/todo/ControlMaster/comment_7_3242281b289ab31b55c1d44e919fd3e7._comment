thanks for all the advice, pabs and joeyh! :)

joeyh: I suspected there was a lot more to it, and considering what I know of Haskell, I suspect 400 LOC in Haskell would translate into something much more complex in myrepos. :p

pabs: neat trick! couldn't this be merged straight into mr though? it seems you have reimplemented most of the mr functions in your .mrconfig now. :)

also, now that I switched to `fetch`, i keep up stumbling upon the issue that i have to rerun update everywhere to get the changes... couldn't there be a way to run update (with `--ff-only` maybe) *and* fetch at once? in other words, why doesn't `update` fetch changes from all remotes?
