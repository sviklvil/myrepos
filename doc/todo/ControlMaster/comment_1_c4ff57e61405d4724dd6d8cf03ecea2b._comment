I've worked to getting most of my remote repos over https instead of SSH. This is mainly because I have a prompt for each use of my SSH keys, but also helps with this problem.

I'm using ControlMaster for all SSH connections, with some situations where I turn it off, and I find it works fairly well apart from the annoying race condition you mention during `mr fetch`. I use time-limited connections so I don't have SSH running forever.

Instead of configuring ControlMaster for all SSH connections, you could also just configure it for the hosts that you can only use git with (I'm thinking github.com/etc).

I suggest putting SSH sockets in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR instead of HOME, so you never get stale sockets after reboot and never get backup programs looking at sockets (some do).

```
ControlMaster autoask
ControlPath /run/user/%i/ssh-control-%l->%r@%h:%p
ControlPersist 60
```

To be honest I'm not sure how myrepos could selectively enable ControlMaster for commands it runs. The only thing I can think of would be to modify PATH to add a script that runs the real `ssh` with additional options, but that seems pretty hacky.

Either way, if ControlMaster provides very little improvement for you, adding it via myrepos instead of via the SSH config isn't going to change that.

PS: I only ever do `mr -j10 fetch` and I leave updating branches to interactive shells where I can deal with any conflicts manually.
