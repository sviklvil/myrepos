git-annex contains a robust implementation of this in Annex/Ssh.hs.
It's nontrivial; my implementation is over 400 LoC.

Some other complications that may or may not have been discussed:

* The path to a unix socket is limited to around 100 bytes,
  so using the full server name in the socket name will sometimes fail.
* Multiple password prompting has to be avoided when there's concurrency.
  This and ssh failing on a socket that is not yet connected can both be
  dealt with by locking until a connection is set up, running a dummy
  command like "true" has to be run over ssh to know when the connection is
  up.
